# CinemaHub

## Description

CinemaHub is a React project that uses Vite as the build tool and ESLint to maintain code quality. This repository provides a minimal setup to start developing React applications with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight development environment that provides an optimized development experience.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting patterns in JavaScript code, helping to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Features

- Basic structure of a React project.
- ESLint configuration to ensure best practices in the code.
- Support for Fast Refresh using two Vite plugins:
  - @vitejs/plugin-react: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
  - @vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Installation

To get started with CinemaHub, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ypz22/CinemaHub.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   
```bash
   cd CinemaHub
```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   
```bash
   npm install
```

## Usage

##  Quick Start

###  Frontend

Run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command is run in the root of the project where the frontend is located.

---

### ðŸ›  Backend

To start the backend server with nodemon:

```bash
cd backend
nodemon server.js
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in the backend folder.

---

## âœ… Requirements

- Node.js and npm installed
- Nodemon installed globally (you can do this with npm install -g nodemon)

## ðŸ§ª Notes

- The frontend usually runs on http://localhost:3000
- The backend can run on http://localhost:5000 or another port defined in server.js
This will start the application in development mode and automatically open your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## How It Works

CinemaHub is designed to provide a seamless user experience for browsing movies. The application fetches data from a movie API and displays it in an organized manner. Users can view details about different movies, including titles, descriptions, and images.

## Linting

To check the code quality, you can run ESLint with the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will allow you to identify and fix issues in your code according to the rules defined in the ESLint configuration.
